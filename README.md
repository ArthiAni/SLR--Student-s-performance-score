# SLR-Student's performance score

Simple Linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the correlation or relationship between two variables.
In this task, i have implemented the concept of SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION to find how the score of a student in exam changes with number of hours they study.


### Simple linear regression equation is a straight line with positive/negative/zero slope.
#### Y = M(X) + c
where,
Y is dependent variable 
X is independent variable
M is slope or coefficient
c is intercept or constant
